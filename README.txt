        This is a single battle game where you can choose the trainer you would like to battle.
        Start by entering your name.
        Then select each of your Pokémon:
            You can only have 3 Pokémon.
            This can be done by:
                Entering the Pokémon's number or name. e.g. Entering '1' or 'Bulbasaur' will choose Bulbasaur as your Pokémon. Be careful of spelling.
                Entering '?' will choose a random Pokémon.
        Then select a trainer to battle by entering their number or name similarly to selecting Pokémon.
        After this, the battle will commence.

        See if you can beat them all!

    --challenge - Take on a challenge

        Challenge modes are the hardest challenges within the game.
        Start by entering your name.

        Each challenge will see you take on every trainer, from the region chosen, in succession.
        Defeating all of the trainers within the region will grant you admittance to the Hall of Fame.
        If you think you have what it takes, take on the 'All' challenge which will make you face off against all of the best trainers in the world one after the other.
        From Kanto to Alola, you will face every Gym Leader, Elite Four member, Champion and more until you either crumple under their power or rise up as a true Pokémon Master.

        The Hall of Fame is the highest reward in the game.

            Their name
            The 3 Pokémon they used to beat the challenge.
            The region of the challenge they defeated (or 'All' if they bested the hardest challenge).

    --types - Learn type advantages

        Type advantages are one of the most important aspects of a Pokémon battle.
        Ensuring that you have an advantage over your opponents Pokémon is a great way to ensure your victory.
        With this option you can see a table of the type advantages/disadvantages.
        With the attacking type along the x axis and the defending type along the y axis, you should be able to learn things like Water being strong against Fire.
        However, there are Pokémon with special dual typing where they aren't just a single type.
        This means that a Pokémon may be both weak and strong against a specific type.
        Make sure you are careful when facing a Pokémon with a dual type, as things might not turn out how you expect.
